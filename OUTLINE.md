## How It Works

### üîÑ Automated Playlist Sync

1. **Startup**: App connects to Spotify and starts monitoring
2. **Monitoring**: Every `POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, checks for new tracks
3. **Download**: For each new track:
   - Formats search query: "Artist - Track Name"
   - Searches YouTube using yt-dlp
   - Downloads the first result and saves with clean Spotify filename
4. **Cleanup**: Removes successfully downloaded tracks from playlist
5. **Repeat**: Continues monitoring for new tracks

### üåê Manual Web Downloads

1. **Access**: Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
2. **Input**: Paste any supported media URL (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.)
3. **Customize**: Optionally set a custom filename
4. **Download**: Click download and watch real-time progress
5. **Complete**: Files saved to your configured download directory

### Filename Sources

**Primary (Spotify-based)**: For playlist sync, files are named using the original Spotify track information:

- Format: `Artist - Track Name`
- Examples:
  - `Jessica Audiffred - Don't Speak (feat. GG Magree)`
  - `ATLiens - BLACK SHEEP (feat. GG MAGREE)`
  - `Post Malone - Congratulations ft. Quavo`

**Fallback (YouTube title cleaning)**: For manual downloads or when Spotify info isn't available:

- Automatically removes YouTube video metadata like "[Official Music Video]", "(Official Audio)", etc.
- Examples:
  - `ATLiens - BLACK SHEEP (feat. GG MAGREE) [Official Music Video]` ‚Üí `ATLiens - BLACK SHEEP (feat. GG MAGREE)`
  - `Post Malone - Congratulations ft. Quavo (Official Video)` ‚Üí `Post Malone - Congratulations ft. Quavo`
