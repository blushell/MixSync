## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

For containerized deployment with Docker, see the complete **[Docker Guide](DOCKER.md)** which covers:

- GitHub Container Registry usage
- Docker Compose setup
- Local building
- Development environment
- Troubleshooting and maintenance

### Option 2: Traditional Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mixsync

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Spotify API Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Get your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
4. Add `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` to your app's redirect URIs

### 3. Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp env_example.txt .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your credentials:

   ```env
   # Spotify API Configuration
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
   SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback

   # Playlist Configuration
   SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=your_playlist_id_here

   # Application Settings (Optional - smart polling enabled by default)
   # POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30
   DOWNLOAD_PATH=./downloads
   # MAX_RECENT_DOWNLOADS=10
   # ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING=true

   # Metadata Settings (Optional)
   # ENABLE_METADATA_TAGGING=true
   # DEFAULT_GENRE=Electronic

    # Web Server Configuration (Optional - defaults to localhost:3000)
    # WEB_HOST=localhost
    # WEB_PORT=3000
   ```

### 4. Get Your Playlist ID

1. Open Spotify and go to your playlist
2. Click "Share" ‚Üí "Copy Spotify URI"
3. The URI looks like: `spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`
4. Use just the ID part (after the last colon) in your `.env` file: `37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`

### 5. Run the Application

#### Docker

See the **[Docker Guide](DOCKER.md)** for complete Docker setup instructions.

#### Traditional

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start both services:

- **Web Interface**: Available at `http://localhost:3000`
- **Playlist Sync**: Automatically monitoring your Spotify playlist

## üìñ How It Works

### üîÑ Automated Playlist Sync

1. **Startup**: App connects to Spotify and starts smart monitoring your playlist
2. **Smart Monitoring**: Checks every 30 seconds, with intelligent backoff when idle
3. **Download Process**: For each new track:
   - Creates search query: "Artist - Track Name"
   - Searches YouTube using yt-dlp
   - Downloads the best quality audio available
   - Saves with clean Spotify filename
4. **Cleanup**: Removes successfully downloaded tracks from playlist
5. **Smart Adaptation**: Adjusts monitoring frequency based on activity

### üß† Smart Polling System

The playlist sync uses intelligent polling that adapts to your usage:

- **Fast Response**: Checks every 30 seconds by default for immediate detection
- **Activity Detection**: When new tracks are added, maintains fast polling
- **Energy Efficient**: Gradually increases interval (up to 5 minutes) when playlist is idle
- **Auto-Recovery**: Returns to fast polling when activity resumes
- **No Configuration**: Works automatically without needing manual timing setup

### üåê Manual Web Downloads

1. **Access**: Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. **Input**: Paste any supported media URL
3. **Customize**: Optionally set a custom filename
4. **Download**: Click download and watch real-time progress
5. **Complete**: Files saved to your configured download directory
6. **History**: View complete download history at `/history` with search and filters

### üóÑÔ∏è Database & History Features

MixSync includes a comprehensive SQLite database that tracks every download:

- **Complete Records**: Every download attempt is logged with detailed metadata
- **Smart Search**: Search by filename, artist, track name, or any text
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by download status (completed/failed/processing) or source (playlist/manual)
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Visual overview showing:
  - Total downloads and success rate
  - Playlist vs manual download breakdown
  - Total file sizes and storage usage
- **Pagination**: Handle thousands of downloads efficiently
- **Real-time Updates**: New downloads appear immediately
- **Historical Data**: Never lose track of what you've downloaded

**Database Location**: `audio_fetcher.db` in project root directory

**Database Schema**: Tracks filename, artist, track name, source URL, file size, download status, timestamps, and more.

### üè∑Ô∏è Automatic Metadata Tagging

MixSync automatically sets ID3 tags on all downloaded MP3 files:

- **From Spotify**: When downloading from playlists, uses original Spotify metadata (artist, title, album)
- **From Filenames**: For manual downloads, intelligently extracts artist and title from filenames
- **Smart Cleaning**: Removes YouTube artifacts like "[Official Video]", "(Lyrics)", etc.
- **Smart Album Filtering**: Only sets album field for real albums, skips singles and generic names
- **Configurable Genre**: Set your preferred default genre (default: "Electronic")
- **Automatic BPM Detection**: Uses librosa to analyze and set BPM values on audio files

**Metadata Tags Set:**

- `Artist` - Track artist name
- `Title` - Track title (cleaned of artifacts)
- `Album` - Real album names only (skips singles, EPs, and generic names)
- `Genre` - Configurable default genre
- `BPM` - Automatically detected using audio analysis (configurable)

**Example Metadata:**

```
Artist: "Jessica Audiffred"
Title: "Don't Speak"
Album: (none - single track)
Genre: "Electronic"
BPM: 152
```

**Album Field Logic:**

- ‚úÖ **Sets Album**: "My Great Album", "The Best of 2024", "House Classics Vol. 2"
- ‚ùå **Skips Album**: "Don't Speak - Single", "Track Name (Single)", "Song EP", "Track Name"

**BPM Detection:**

- ‚úÖ **Automatic Analysis**: Uses librosa's beat tracking algorithm
- ‚úÖ **Smart Processing**: Analyzes 30 seconds from the middle of tracks
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Only sets BPM values between 60-200 (typical music range)
- ‚úÖ **Fallback Methods**: Uses onset detection if beat tracking fails
- ‚úÖ **Configurable**: Can be disabled via `ENABLE_BPM_DETECTION=false`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Configuration errors found"**

- Make sure you've copied `env_example.txt` to `.env`
- Fill in all required Spotify API credentials
- Check that your playlist ID is correct

**"Could not authenticate with Spotify"**

- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret
- Ensure the redirect URI matches your Spotify app settings
- Check that your Spotify app has the correct permissions

**"Download failed"**

- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and available in PATH
- Check that the URL is from a supported platform
- Some content may be geo-restricted or unavailable

**"Web interface not accessible"**

- Check that port 3000 is not in use by another application
- Try changing `WEB_PORT` in your `.env` file (add `WEB_PORT=8000` for example)
- Ensure your firewall allows connections to the port
- For Docker: Check that the port mapping is correct (`-p 3000:3000`)

**Docker Issues**

For Docker-specific troubleshooting, see the **[Docker Guide](DOCKER.md)** which covers common container issues, networking, permissions, and debugging.

### Logs

Check the application logs for detailed error information:
